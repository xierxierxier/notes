## Chapter 9
[[undead - 0]] | [[undead - 8]] | [[undead - 10]]

B Military Zone. Emergency Contact Room.

"Analysis of all collected data on the Omegas has been completed. There is no match for the target's DNA."

The red emergency lights flickered on the face of the female researcher. There was sweat on her face from running and her breathing was forced. Next to her an old man in epaulettes buried his face in his hands.

After a few moment he raised his head again. "Understood."

The old man picked up the handset for the satellite phone and dialled in a pin number. After an agonizing half minute, the other side finally picked up. "Major General Qian, please report your situation."

The old man opened his mouth but did not speak.

But that silence said everything.
