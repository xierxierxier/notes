Synopsis:

When a virus that turns its victims into zombies suddenly begins, it's only a matter of months before it overruns the entire globe. Communications break down, water and electricity supplies dwindle, chemical factories begin to leak, nuclear powerplants explode, and modern civilisation crumbles. In this is an era of no heroes, no kings, no preordained saviours it falls to the members of the 118th Unit to find and deliver the antidote.
